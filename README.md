Problem statement
Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.

Task List
You are a data analyst who has been provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard to work on the following task. You can download all relevant documents from the download section.

Create the metrics according to the metric list.
Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.

## Key Learnings from the Project

Created a custom Calendar Visual using a matrix table, enabling flexible date-based analysis for multiple business scenarios. 

Studied hotel cancellation policies and observed that most hotels allow free cancellation only if it is made at least three months prior to the booking date. Beyond that period, cancellation charges typically range from 60% to 90% of the booking cost.

Mastered bookmarks and selection features in Power BI to enhance interactivity—used for page navigation, implementing a “clear filter” button, and creating a website-like navigation experience. 

Applied a consistent color palette across the dashboard for improved aesthetics and brand alignment.
